# Fantasy-Premier-League

## Project Objective

> Based on fantasy draft results of last year, get the data from Fantasy Premier League site and use it to do exploratory analysis.

> Next part of this project is to project the scores of each individual player and form a better team based on that. For that, we will need data for some more part of the season.
